Light following anthropomorphic robot using rough prototyping design language.

The light bug is composed of a breadboard, two 360 servo motors with arms, three light sensors (photo resistors), arduino and battery pack. There is minimal addition or change to the components - three zip ties hold the the servos and battery pack and everything else is held physically by the bread board.

Since the photo resistors face forwards, right, and left, the system can sense light and control it's motion by rotating it's arms forwards or back. When both arms rotate forwards the light bug moves forwards, and when the arms turn in opposite direction it turns. The inaccurate and sporadic dragging movement creates an organic sensation.
